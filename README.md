# ts-code-enum

A TypeScript string enum for compile-time safety when working with `event.code`.

Inspired by https://gitlab.com/nfriend/ts-key-enum.

## Installation

```sh
npm install ts-code-enum --save
```

```sh
yarn add ts-code-enum
```

## Usage

For a [basic `enum`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#enums):
```ts
import { KBCode } from "ts-code-enum";
```

For a [`const enum`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/enums.html#const-enums):
```ts
import { KBCode } from "ts-code-enum/const";
```

Then:
```ts
// if (ev.code === 'Escape') { ... }
if (ev.code === KBCode.Escape) { ... }
```

`const enums` are replaced by plain strings at compile-time. If you are using Typescript and your toolchain supports `const enum`, use `ts-code-enum/const`. Otherwise use `ts-code-enum`.

## About `event.code`

[MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent/code): The `KeyboardEvent.code` property represents a physical key on the keyboard (as opposed to the character generated by pressing the key). In other words, this property returns a value that isn't altered by keyboard layout or the state of the modifier keys.

Enum data is obtained by scraping the `code` values for major platforms from [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/UI_Events/Keyboard_event_code_values). Values are included if they are present on **all** major platforms. Alphanumeric keys such as `KBCode.KeyQ = "KeyQ"` are included.
